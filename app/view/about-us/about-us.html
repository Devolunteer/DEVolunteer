      <h4>Jacob Isenberg <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jisenber/"><img src="../../assets/img/stock/linkedin-icon.png" alt="LinkedIn Profile" width="30" height="30" border="0"></a></h4>
      <p>
        Jacob was born and raised in Seattle, Washington, and outside of stint in Washington D.C., he has not found a good enough reason to move elsewhere. He is a graduate of the University of Washington, class of 2013. He has worked at the US House of Representatives, the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, and learned to code from the Code Fellows nights and weekends program. Outside of work and class you can probably find Jacob playing softball, eating seafood, or golfing poorly at the local pitch n’ putt course.
